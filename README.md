## Introduction
![listr_logo](images/listr_logo.png)

Streaming has become the primary listening format for music in the last decade. It hasgrown at an average rate of 43.9% since 2014 with an annual revenue of $13.7B in theUnited States alone in 2022 [[1]](#1). With any highly profitable business, there are bound tobe many competitors vying for their own share. Spotify currently dominates theglobal music streaming market share at 32% in 2021, but that is on the decline as theywere at 34% in 2019 [[2]](#2). The market is oversaturated-- Amazon Music and YouTubeMusic increased their subscriber count by 25% and 50% respectively in 2021.

You may ask, "why would we join an oversaturated market?"

The answer is simple. Our AI generated playlists brings a personalized touch that setsus apart from the rest of the market. Music is very personal. No two people will haveexactly the same tastes, so their playlists should be unique to them.

Aside from personalized playlists, users can ask our chatbot to make them playlistsbased on prompts such as "songs about Tennessee" or "Taylor Swift's saddest songs"
Consumers only need one subscription; we'll make sure Listr is the one they choose.
